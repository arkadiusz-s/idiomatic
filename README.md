# idiomatic
Idiomatic is intended to be a multi-idiom compiler for [fluent](https://github.com/ucbrise/fluent).

The first idiom that it supports is a subset of [Bloom](http://bloom-lang.net). This is a work-in-progress.

This project currently requires Python 3, and the TatSu parser library (`pip install tatsu`). Best starting point is in [`examples/chat`](./examples/chat)
